There are event files in the /events directory, these are text from the whole facebook event page. These are mostly running/cycling/swimming  events. The filename is in the <eventId>.txt format. I want you to go through each of the files in the /events directory and extract these info for each file:

name: name of the event
date: the date of the event
distance: the distance of the event, should be just the number in kilometers, for example: 21.1, 10, 5
location: comma seperated location of the event, Bangladesh should be ommited from the location, for example instead of Dhaka, Bangladesh it should be just Dhaka
fee: the fee of the event
earlyBirdFee: the early bird fee of the event
website: the website of the event
tags: comma seperated tags for the event, for example: AIMS if the event is AIMS certified
responseCount: the number of people responded to the event
fbLink: the facebook link of the event

Then save all these in a json `events.json`. If there are multiple distances in a event, create entry for each distance. Append the distance to the name of the event, for example:  `SHERPUR HALF MARATHON 2025 | 10k`. Note that fees are usually different for different distances, so make sure to extract the correct fee for each distance. Put null if you can't find any of the info.

You can't use any scripts, you have to read each of them. After reading each of the file you should update the json file.

Read the existing `events.json` file and append new events to it. You can skip reading an event file if its eventId is already in the `events.json` file.
