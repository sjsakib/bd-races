Saidpur Runners is thrilled to announce the highly anticipated event: the extended and revamped edition of the esteemed Saidpur 10k, now recognized as the Northern Half Marathon 2025!
This exhilarating race is set to take place on Friday, 26 September, 2025, in the picturesque town of Saidpur!


𝐍𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐧 𝐇𝐚𝐥𝐟 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧:
Following the success of last year's Saidpur 10k, which emerged as a leading running event in 2024, we received tremendous enthusiasm and encouragement from participants and stakeholders to organize a similar event, but as a half marathon. Fueled by this energy and our past plans, we at Saidpur Runners are thrilled to announce that the Northern Half Marathon is the event you’ve asked for.
With a vision that encompasses the greater part of North Bengal, Bangladesh, we have rebranded and are excited to move forward with the name “Northern Half.” In this new edition, the course will be largely similar to last year’s, with an expanded vision that includes all districts of the northern region of Bangladesh as part of the Northern Half.
The Northern Half Marathon will be more than just a race; it will be a festival celebrating runners and a gathering for all participants. This event will honor love for running, joy, tradition, and a chance to connect with nature. Participants will have the opportunity to experience the vibrant culture and rich history of the city, as well as the natural beauty of North Bengal. This occasion is not just a typical running event; it's a unique experience—a celebration that honors fitness, culture, wellness, and community unity.
The Northern Half Marathon 2025 is officially a member of the prestigious AIMS (Association of International Marathons and Distance Races: The home of world running™). This is not just a race; it's an opportunity to be part of a global running community that inspires and motivates runners from all over the world.
