For the very first time, we're inviting you to be part of an extraordinary aquatic adventure – the Bengal Swimming Challenge!\nOn December 12th - 13th, 2025, join us in the stunning coastal district of Barguna as we plunge into the mighty Bishkhali River. This isn't just a race; it's an immersive journey through the heart of Bangladesh's natural beauty.\nChoose Your Challenge – Distances Tailored for Every Swimmer:\nWe believe in making open-water swimming accessible and exciting for everyone. Whether you're taking your first stroke in a river or a seasoned marathon swimmer, we have a challenge perfectly suited for you.\n* 1 KM - The Introductory Dip:\n* Ideal for: Beginners, recreational swimmers, or those looking to experience river swimming for the first time without committing to a longer distance.\n* Experience: A perfect introduction to the unique currents and serene beauty of the Bishkhali. It's a fantastic way to test your open-water skills in a supportive environment.\n* Expected Duration: Typically takes 20-40 minutes for most swimmers.\n* 3 KM - The Enthusiast's Expedition:\n* Ideal for: Swimmers with some open-water experience, triathletes, or those who regularly swim in pools and are ready for a moderate river challenge.\n* Experience: This distance offers a more substantial test of endurance while still allowing you to soak in the picturesque surroundings of the river and its mangrove-lined banks.\n* 5 KM - The Endurance Quest:\n* Ideal for: Experienced open-water swimmers, marathon enthusiasts, and athletes looking to push their boundaries in a natural setting.\n* Experience: This is a significant open-water challenge that demands stamina and mental fortitude. You'll gain a deeper appreciation for the river's expanse and the vibrant life along its shores as you navigate this classic open-water distance.\n* 8 KM - The Ultimate River Marathon:\n* Ideal for: Elite open-water swimmers, seasoned long-distance competitors, and those seeking the ultimate test of endurance and perseverance.\n* Experience: The crowning jewel of the Bengal Swimming Challenge. This marathon distance will challenge every aspect of your open-water swimming ability, offering a truly epic journey across the Bishkhali River. Conquer this, and you'll have earned serious bragging rights!\nA Swimmer's Paradise in Southern Bangladesh:\nImagine cutting through the serene waters of the Bishkhali River, with the lush greenery of mangrove forests gracing the riverbanks. This unique backdrop offers not just a challenging swim but a breathtaking experience. Southern Bangladesh is a land defined by its intricate network of rivers, estuaries, and the Bay of Bengal. With an estimated 24,000 kilometers of rivers crisscrossing the delta, these waterways are the lifeblood of countless communities, supporting a vibrant ecosystem and the livelihoods of thousands of resilient fishermen.\nAs you navigate the currents, you'll witness firsthand the authentic charm of riverine life. Keep an eye out for local fishing boats, their sails billowing in the breeze, as fishermen expertly cast their nets – a timeless scene that speaks volumes of the region's heritage. The air itself carries the fresh scent of the river and the gentle rustle of leaves from the nearby sundori and gewa trees, creating an unparalleled atmosphere.\nWhy Swim the Bishkhali?\nThe Bishkhali River, flowing through the heart of Barguna, offers an ideal setting for open-water swimming. Its expansive stretches and relatively calm currents in December provide a safe yet exhilarating environment. This is your chance to conquer a unique challenge, test your limits, and create unforgettable memories in a truly spectacular natural setting.\nThis is the 1st edition of the Bengal Swimming Challenge, and we invite you to be a foundational part of its legacy. Don't miss this incredible opportunity to swim in one of Bangladesh's most picturesque rivers and contribute to the growing open-water swimming community.\nPresented By Run Bangladesh – bringing you the best in adventure sports!\nMark your calendars! Registration details coming soon.\nGet ready to feel the flow, embrace the challenge, and experience the beauty of Barguna like never before.

The women of Bangladesh, across age groups, especially among the socially backward strata are neglecting their health and thereby impacting the generations to follow.\nTo address this issue, Nuvista Pharma, the first Women-Centric Pharma Company in Bangladesh, is organizing \"Run for Women”, a community-focused event to encourage women. This 10 KM run for women event is aimed at promoting physical health, mental well-being, and social connection among women. Women must stand for women. And so should all men, who value women.\nThis run is designed to encourage women to prioritize their health and inspire men to provide their full support in advancing women's health and well-being in Bangladesh.\nThere will be 10 KM and a 5 KM category for both men and women. Minimum age has to be 14 years and 12 years to be eligible for participating in 10 KM and 5 KM category respectively.\nRace Date: 6th February 2026\nLocation: Mirpur DOHS area\nRace Reporting Time: 0500 AM\nRace START Time: 0600 AM\nWhat all runners would receive for the race:\n* Beautiful wooden medal\n* Race Jersey\n* Chip based timing\n* Hydration on track\n* Post-race meal\nThere will be Attractive gifts and award for the podium holders.\n*Podium will be decided basing on GUN TIME\n*Organizer preserves the authority to decide on any aspect regarding race result after consulting with Race Marshall See less\nHosts\nNuvista RUN for WOMEN\nRafiqul Haider Linkon\nSuggested events\nThu, 9 Oct at 10:00 +06\nAARONG OPENS IN SHYAMOLI\n10, Shyamoli Ring Road, Mohammadpur\n10555 people interested\nHappening now\nCleaning Campaign (Spring 2025)\n74/A, Green Road, 1205 Dhaka, Bangladesh\n160 people interested\nSat, 11 Oct at 09:00 +06\n🎓 Study in New Zealand: Admission & PR Info Day ✅\nHouse #313, Road #21, Mohakhali DOHS, 1206 Dhaka, Bangladesh\n910 people interested\nEvent transparency\nFacebook is showing information to help you better understand the purpose of this event.\nSee more\nPrivacy\n \n · Terms\n \n · Advertising\n \n · Ad choices \n \n · Cookies\n \n · More\nLog in or sign up for Facebook to connect with friends, family and people you know.\nLog in\nor\nCreate new account"

Fueled by this energy and our past plans, we at Saidpur Runners are thrilled to announce that the Northern Half Marathon is the event you’ve asked for.\nWith a vision that encompasses the greater part of North Bengal, Bangladesh, we have rebranded and are excited to move forward with the name “Northern Half.” In this new edition, the course will be largely similar to last year’s, with an expanded vision that includes all districts of the northern region of Bangladesh as part of the Northern Half.\nThe Northern Half Marathon will be more than just a race; it will be a festival celebrating runners and a gathering for all participants. This event will honor love for running, joy, tradition, and a chance to connect with nature. Participants will have the opportunity to experience the vibrant culture and rich history of the city, as well as the natural beauty of North Bengal. This occasion is not just a typical running event; it's a unique experience—a celebration that honors fitness, culture, wellness, and community unity.\nThe Northern Half Marathon 2025 is officially a member of the prestigious AIMS (Association of International Marathons and Distance Races: The home of world running™). This is not just a race; it's an opportunity to be part of a global running community that inspires and motivates runners from all over the world.\n𝐊𝐢𝐭 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐨:\n25th September, 2025\nBandhon Convention Centre, Saidpur\nFrom 2 PM to 11 PM\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/w2sf1NQrnjrvcLo56?g_st=ipc\n\n\n𝐑𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐞: Friday, 26th September, 2025\n𝐑𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬:\n- Half Marathon\n- 10K Run\n- 5K Run\n- 1K Kids Run\n\n\n𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞:\nLive, and there is no chance of virtual run.\n𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:\nClosed\n𝐑𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐞: Road Run (village road) expecting to be accredited by IAAF-AIMS.\n𝐑𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭: 5.30 AM.\nStarting Point:\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/9Sa4i8P7FcyQwSEu7\n\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞: 4.45 AM.\n\n\n𝐂𝐮𝐭 𝐎𝐟𝐟 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞:\nHalf Marathon: 3 Hours and 45 Minutes\n10K: 100 Minutes\n5K: N/A\n1K: N/A\n\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐢𝐯𝐞:\n• Access to the expo kit, allowing to enjoy a variety of attractions.\n• BIB\n• T-shirt\n• Kits bag with UNEXPECTED GIFTS!\n• Chip timing result\n• Hydration\n• Medical Support\n• Physiotherapy Support\n• Food and refreshment\n• Washroom facility\n• Bag drops service\n• Foreign-made Medal\n• E- Certificate\n𝐏𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐮𝐦:\nCategories and prize will be published soon.\n𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞:\n➢ This event is exclusively for non-professional runners.
