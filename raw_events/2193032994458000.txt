Nuvista "Run for Women" – The Reason to Be There
Women’s health continues to be impacted by a lack of awareness, especially in Bangladesh.
Symptoms of conditions such as hypothyroidism, endometriosis, fibroids, high-risk pregnancies, and menopause are evolving, but awareness remains poor. The women of Bangladesh, across age groups, especially among the socially backward strata are neglecting their health and thereby impacting the generations to follow.
To address this issue, Nuvista Pharma, the first Women-Centric Pharma Company in Bangladesh, is organizing "Run for Women”, a community-focused event to encourage women. This 10 KM run for women event is aimed at promoting physical health, mental well-being, and social connection among women. Women must stand for women. And so should all men, who value women.
This run is designed to encourage women to prioritize their health and inspire men to provide their full support in advancing women's health and well-being in Bangladesh.
There will be 10 KM and a 5 KM category for both men and women. Minimum age has to be 14 years and 12 years to be eligible for participating in 10 KM and 5 KM category respectively.
