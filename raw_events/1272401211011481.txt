"Let's all run together on the path of health and awareness...!
Running is one of the means for physical and mental health. Let's run together and spread the message of physical and mental health practices from Narayanganj to all over Bangladesh. This event is not just a running event, but is moving forward with the goal of making it a memorable initiative of Narayanganj district.
We want to convey an important message through this event, the importance of protecting the environment and conserving rivers along with industrial development. Narayanganj is an important industrial and commercial area. The lifeblood of this region is the Shitalakshya River. This development cannot be imagined without the river.
So let's take an oath through running...↓
"𝐒𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐑𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫, 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐲"
With the participation of you and all the runners in your team, our event will be successful, InshaAllah.
